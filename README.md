## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Animation
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This project was one of my first bigger projects. So I decided to challenge myself and use react and not just html!

**Things I learned:**

- The best way to trigger a CSS animation is to add a class with that animation and them remove it after.

- Being able to use handlers to pass events from a child to a parent.


### Continued development

I'll continue to work on my skills and create harder and harder projects.
